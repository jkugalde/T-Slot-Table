# Resume

I made a simple T-Slot table, it makes me really happy because i finally have a place to work in my small apartment :D. It may be a little expensive (170 dollars buying the parts from the local store (in Chile) instead of aliexpressing them, without the plank or the 3d printed parts), but if you are not happy with it you can always disassemble it a made another project with the parts, all hail the modular construction systems!

## Description

It has a plywood top (150x56x1.2 cms) bolted in an aluminium frame made with 30x30 t-slot profiles and accesories, also some 3d printed parts. The surface stands 77 cms above the floor. The bolt head surface is coincident with the top surface.

 I 3d printed the caps and the 45 degree brackets, as my local store did not sell them, the files are included in the parts folder. The foots could have been an adjustable level mechanism but i did not really need that, so i put caps in there, aswell as in the ends of the 1500 mm profiles to avoid getting cut.

## Manufacturing

### Plywood top

I made the plywood top using a CNC, so it was really easy. It has 12 holes and pockets, to put the bolts and fit their heads. I could have used countersink bolts, but i had some flat heads that were ok. If you want to use another kind of bolt (or a top with a different thickness) remember to adjust the pocket to fit the head and use the right length to attach to the T nut in the aluminium frame.

You dont really need a CNC as it is just a square with holes, which are 6 mm to allow a M5 bolt to pass through it and some play.

### 3D Printing

I used the caps from this [file](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43756) in Thingiverse.

I designed the 45 degree bracket to be bolted with a M8 socket bolt into the ends of a 30x30 t slot, you can get it from the parts folder or from my [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4552605/files).

It has to be printed this way so the face where the aluminium profile is bolted be flat. No supports or raft needed.
